# Earthquake_Data_Analysis
A Java program that collects data from a website and analyses it. The solutions for the program were to be able to print out the quake data in an easy to read format, print out the shallowest, deepest and strongest quakes and display the earthquakes in both a Google map and an image map.

(Must be run using a compatible Java compiler on the command line. Calling 'ant -p' while in the root directory of the folder will show the various commands that can be run, showing the various solutions.)
